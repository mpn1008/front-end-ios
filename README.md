## Author's message:
Hello, thank you for visiting my GitHub. First, please take a look at the product's architecture
![Image of Architecture](https://i.imgur.com/Yv5VaP6.png)

So there are 2 functions
1. Displaying real-time data that is collected by the sensor (using socket.io). This function requires you to have the IoT hardware.
2. Displaying historical data. This function is usable. However, there are only 2 days that have the data stored (August 26th 2019 and August 28th 2019). If you want to test this function, please select those 2 days.

Thank you and best regards,
Phuong Nguyen
